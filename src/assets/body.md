# Introduction

The ***sece*** system is a web-based application that allows both University and Non-University employers to advertise and manage their job listings. When these jobs are approved they are added to the jobs database where they become available to eligible students. Job listings will remain on record and can be reused by employers.

UH employers are also allowed to create and manage student placement records that interface with the University of Hawaii's payroll system. This ability to create and manage placement records is contingent upon receiving training on the ***sece*** system from an authorized representative from your campus or department.

## Campus/Department Liaisons

UH Manoa employers will have a department liaison and employers at all other campuses will have a campus liaison. These liaisons serve as an intermediary between the student employment office at the campus and the end-users.

In addition to conveying information and updates from the student employment office, liaisons are responsible for training employers on the ***sece*** system. This training is required in order to receive what is called Placement Access. Placement Access allows an employer to create and approve placement transactions.

## Confirmation and Error Messages

When using the ***sece*** system, you will receive a message whenever you submit or save a transaction. The page will refresh and the message will appear above the transaction header. If it says the data was updated successfully, the transaction had no problems and was saved or submitted. A red message indicates that there was a problem and the issues should be indicated by red text on the transaction.

{help-success-message}

## Website Problems

When using the ***sece*** system, if you encounter a problem you may contact support at [sece-help@lists.hawaii.edu](mailto:sece-help@lists.hawaii.edu). Before doing so, you may want to check to make sure your browser is set to accept cookies and that your firewall is not blocking the site. If the problem is a display error, you may want to make sure you are running the most current version of your browser or try using a different browser.

## Navigating the Site

The following are some basic tips for navigating on the ***sece*** system:

* __Drop-Down Fields:__ These fields limit the user to selecting from a series of set options.
* __Help Icons:__ The solid icon with a white question mark inside is a link that can be clicked to get a pop-up with helpful information about a page or a section of a page.
* __Image Links:__ These are images that link to other pages or pop-ups. When you mouse-over an image link the mouse icon will change to a pointing hand.
* __Searches:__ When conducting a search you can search by full words/names or you can use a wildcard to search by part of a word/name.
  To perform a wildcard search, type the first few letters and end with a % symbol. For example, searching using "pan%" will search for all words starting with the letters "pan."
* __Sub-Tabs:__ When on some tabs, a series of text links at the top of the page may appear. These are called sub-tabs and they take you to different screens within that section.
* __Tabs:__ Similar to tabs in a binder, these tabs at the top of the screen divide the functions of sece into related functions. For the employer, these tabs are Jobs/Other, Placements/Forms, and Timesheet.
* __Text Fields:__ White text fields can be typed in-to by the user.
* __Text Links:__ Text links will appear as text that is underlined or dark blue. Clicking on a text link will typically take you to another page linked to that text. When you mouse-over a text link the mouse icon will change to a pointing hand.
* __Timing Out:__ If you are idle while logged in for around 15 minutes, the system will log you out. Please keep this in mind while creating jobs or doing other lengthy actions, as this could cause you to lose your data. Saving periodically will prevent the system from logging you out.

## EEO/AA

The University of Hawaii is an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Affirmative Action (AA) employer, and as such, users of the sece system must comply with the relevant federal and state laws and regulations.

## FERPA

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Employers should consult the relevant laws before releasing information to anyone other than the student.

## Administrative Procedures Manuals

The Administrative Procedures Manuals (APM) can be found as a link on the Placements/Forms tab of sece. These two documents define the policies and procedures governing student employment at the University. [APM A9.860](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/ap9.860.pdf) defines grievance procedures and [APM A9.880](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ap&policyChapter=9&policyNumber=880) covers all other policies and procedures related to student employment.

## The Hiring Process

The following is a brief introduction to the hiring process. For more details, please refer to the Hiring Policies & Procedures document on the _Forms and Info_ tab, or [Hiring a Student Employee](#hiring-a-student-employee) in this document.

1. Create a job or open an existing job on the sece system.
2. Eligible students interested in the position will add the job to their job cart. If they are interested in applying for the position, they will hit the apply button that adds them to your applicant list.
3. Students apply for the position as the employer indicated on the job.
4. The best candidate is selected and an offer is made. Those not selected should be promptly informed so they can continue their job search.
5. The employer creates the Hire transaction using the Hire button on the applicant list. The job should be closed if no further recruitment will be done. Note that you can only generate Hires and/or close jobs after either five candidates add it to their job cart or three days have passed.
6. The student will need to do the Federal Form I-9 with the SE office of the campus with which the job is affiliated. Additional forms might be required.
7. The student should complete the tax forms H-4 and HW-4 with the employer. The employer retains these documents and uses them to complete the federal and state withholding section of the Hire transaction.
8. Students should not begin working until the online Hire transaction has been approved by your department and the campus SE office.

## Glossary of Terms

## Jobs Tab

The _Jobs_ tab is primarily used to create and manage job listings on sece. The following is a brief introduction to this module and some relevant information regarding jobs on sece.

### Jobs vs. Job Series

On ***sece***, all jobs are identified by a unique job number and an associated pay class (also called a pay code). When there is only one job with that job number, it can be referred to as a single job. When there are multiple jobs that share that job number, they form a job series.

{help-job-series}

Jobs in a job series should be related and progressive, such that an employer can promote or downgrade a student without having to go through the hiring process again. A series may have up to seven jobs, one for each pay class (A1-A7). A typical series will look something like the following series:

| Job# | Position Title                 |
|------|--------------------------------|
|348-A1|Laboratory Assistant (Trainee)  |
|348-A2|Laboratory Assistant I          |
|348-A3|Laboratory Assistant II         |
|348-A4|Laboratory Researcher I         |
|348-A5|Laboratory Researcher II        |
|348-A6|Research Assistant I            |
|348-A7|Research Assistant II           |

Each position in a job series has its own position title, qualifications, duties, location, and so on. However, the jobs share certain information that when changed on one job will be changed on all other jobs in the series. The following are the shared aspects of the jobs in a series:

* Job funding source
* Primary job category
* Job contact information
* Transaction approvers
* Timesheet approvers

## Jobs as Templates

A job on the sece system can be thought of more as a template rather than the actual hiring record. A student's hire transaction (discussed later) is the actual employment record which is generated based on the information contained in the job.

What this means is that a single job can be used to hire multiple students during a single recruitment or even be used later to hire new/additional students. For example, if you need to hire two students for the same sort of work, you can open a single job and hire both under that same job number. The only time you will need to create a new job for each hire is when the students will be performing different functions or different qualifications are required. Otherwise, a job can be re-opened and re-used as often as you need it.

### Adding Users to Sections 1, 2, and 3

To assign users to roles in section 1, 2, and 3 you will need to have their UH usernames. UH usernames are the part of their email proceeding the @ symbol in their email address. For example, if their email address is *tarao@hawaii.edu*, their UH username is *tarao*.

You may only enter usernames of individuals who have been assigned a UH username and who have the proper affiliation (staff or faculty). In addition, the user must have created a profile on sece to be entered into these sections.

### Section 1: Job/Referral Contact

Section 1 of the job is where you can set not only the contacts for the job, but also who has access to the job. Anyone listed in section 1 will be able to access and make changes to the job. It is generally good practice to have at least two users listed in this section so that if the primary contact is unavailable, someone still has access to the job.

* __Primary & Secondary Job/Referral Contact:__ The users listed in these roles, and their contact information, will be printed on the how to apply pop-up. Students applying for the position will contact these individuals.
* __Additional Job Contact:__ The user listed here can access the job (edit, open, and close), but will not be shown on the how to apply pop-up or serve as a job contact.
* __Admin Contact:__ This line is not accessible by employers. Users with administrative access may, for whatever reason, be listed here by the SE office.

One of the users listed in section one must be designated as the supervisor. Click the radio button next to the appropriate username to designate the supervisor.

### Section 2: Hire and Placement Approval

This section of the job is where you can set who will be in the approval chain for hires and transactions related to the job. When a hire or transaction is created, each user listed will be prompted to approve the transaction. A user that is lower in the chain can always opt to bypass the approval of those above them in the chain. You are not required to input a user on every line, but the supervisor from section 1 will be listed by default on the supervisor line and you must have a Fiscal Authority.

* __Preparer/Reviewer:__ Preparers usually handle the details related to transactions on behalf of the supervisor. You are not required to have a preparer.
* __Supervisor:__ The supervisor line will be automatically filled with the supervisor selected in section 1.
* __Additional Approval:__ Some departments may require additional approvals, in which case the users can be listed on these lines.
* __Fiscal Authority:__ A user must be designated as the Fiscal Authority. All transactions require the approval of either the FA or backup FA.
* __Backup Fiscal Authority:__ A user may be desig-nated as the backup FA to approve transac-tions when the FA is unavailable.

Note that users who do not have placement access will be unable to approve transactions. Until they receive this access, you may want to make arrangements to have other users bypass their approval. Please contact your department/campus liaison if you need placement access.

### Section 3: Timesheet Approvers

In section 3 you designate the timesheet approvers for any student hired under this job. Approv-ing timesheets can be done by users who do not yet have placement access.

You may designate as many users for each approval role as there are empty fields, but you must designate at least one Supervisor level approver and one Business Office level approver. You may click the *Copy* button to auto-fill the usernames from earlier sections into this section.

* __Supervisor Level:__ Supervisor level approvers generally verify the hours worked by the student.
* __Business Level:__ Business Office level approvers generally monitor the funds and compliance.

## Managing Jobs

For jobs that have already been reviewed and approved by Student Employment you have a variety of options to manage those jobs. The most common tasks are detailed in brief below. When making updates to a job, or adding to a series, the job template will look mostly like a newly created job layout with a few notable differences.

{help-job-manage}

> #### Job Access
> You can only view and manage jobs to which you have access. To have access, you must be listed in section 1 on the job as a contact person.

### Open/Close Jobs

You can open and close jobs in two ways. First, you can quickly do so by using the drop-down option under the Status column. If this option gives an error indicating the job requires updates, you will need to open/close it the second way.

### Editing Jobs

Pressing on the job title will take you to the detailed view. From there you can make any updates and then press the *Submit and Reopen Job* button (or *Submit and Close Job*).

The detailed view of the job will look very much like what you would see when creating a new job. The most significant differences will be noted below.

{help-job-edit-general}

{help-job-locked-data}

> #### Common Edits
> Once a job is approved, you will most commonly be updating things like the closing date, starting date, and number of openings.

> #### Editable Fields
> Note that only white fields will be editable on an existing job. Locked fields can only be modified by the student employment office. Typically pay, duties, and qualifications are locked.

### Reviewing Applicants

You can press on the button in the applicants column to view any applications that have been received. From that interface you can then view any materials they submitted and initiate hires.

When you press the *Applicants* button, you will see the following screen listing all of the applicants.

{help-job-applicants-nodocs}

{help-job-applicants-docs}

### Adding to a Series

When you want to add a job to a series you will press the button *Add to Series* on the same row as the first job in that series. This will generate a duplicate of an existing job in that series that you can then edit and change to the new pay class you would like to add. Jobs being added to a series will require review and approval by your Student Employment office.

Adding a job to a series is much like creating a new job, save that you are working from a base template rather than a blank slate. Remember that jobs in series share a number of features. The remainder of the job not shown in this guide can be edited like normal. Please note that editing section 1, 2, or 3 affects all jobs in the series and that a job added to a series must be approved by SE.

# Hiring a Student Employee

## Hiring Students

This section deals with hiring students using the sece system. The basic hiring process is as follows:

1. Open and advertise the job.
2. Interested and eligible students will add themselves to the applicant list and contact you in the manner specified to apply. The system also now allows online applications.
3. You review applications submitted and conduct interviews.
4. You select a candidate and complete the necessary paperwork with the student. The student may also need to complete a Form I-9 or other paperwork with your campus' student employment office.
5. You can initiate the hire transaction as detailed on the next few pages. Enter the required information on the Hire transaction. Note that some information, such as the account code, might need to be entered by your Fiscal Authority.
6. Approve the transaction by checking your approval box. This will route the hire transaction to the next approver in the chain as determined by the approver list in section 2 on the job.
7. When the Fiscal Authority approves the transaction it will route to the relevant student employment office for final approval.
8. When the student employment office approves the hire, the supervisor and student will receive an email notifying them that the hire has been approved. The student may start working once this email and they should not start before then.

### Things to Keep in Mind

The following are things you should keep in mind before trying to hire a student using sece.

* __Do not interview a student who has not applied for your job.__ Only students who are eligible for your job can add themselves to your applicant list, so making sure they are on that list will save you some potential headaches down the road. Note that a change in a student's enrollment or academic status can change their work eligibility.
* __Do not accept an application in someone else's name.__ Sometimes students get contact information from friends. If the student is not on your applicant list, you will not be able to initiate a hire transaction for them.
* __Be aware that additional forms are required.__ Keep in mind that the student may have to complete additional paperwork not only with yourself, but with the relevant student employment office as well. More details on paperwork are provided later in this section.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you should encounter any problems when initiating the hire transaction, it may be one of the following common issues:

* __Be sure you are listed in section 2 on the job.__ Only users listed in section 2 can initiate a hire transaction.
* __Be sure that the job has been open three days or that five people have added the job to their cart.__

If none of these apply or correct the situation, please feel free to contact your campus student employment office.

### Supplemental Forms

The following are descriptions of the supplemental forms the student may need to complete in order to complete their hire.

#### Federal I-9 Form

This is a federal form that determines an employee's eligibility to legally work in the United States. All employees within the U.S. must complete the form and show the proper documentation. Once you have made an offer of employment to a student, and he/she has accepted that offer, the student should complete this form. By law, the form must be fully executed within three days of starting work, which is one reason why students may not start until their hire is approved by the Student Employment office at your campus.

The form is now electronic and can be started on the sece system by the student, who will complete section 1 and then submit it. Once this is done, the student should bring the required documents to the relevant campus' student employment office to finish the form. Electronic I-9s are good at any campus in the UH system that uses the electronic form.

#### Federal Tax Withholding Form (W-4)

This form is used to determine the Federal income tax withholdings for the employee. The completed form should be retained within your department.

#### State Tax Withholding Form (HW-4)

This form is used to determine the State of Hawaii income tax withholdings for the employee. The completed form should be retained within your department.

### Additional Forms

Some or all of the following forms may be required based on circumstances and your campus' policies. These forms are not part of the standard hiring process, but rather they address special cases or forms.

#### 90-Day Extension

When a student completing a form I-9 presents a receipt for a replacement document, they may be required to complete a 90-day extension memo. A student presenting a receipt for a replacement document has 90 days to return with the actual document. This particular form is only required at UH Mฤnoa.

#### FICA Questionnaire

The FICA Questionnaire is used to determine whether or not a student is *Exempt* from FICA taxes. While this is primarily used to determine their status for the summer months, it can also be used to make this determination for the regular academic terms as well. Typically only Unclassified students will be *Not Exempt* during the regular academic terms (Fall/Spring). The questionnaire does not need to be sent to the student employment office.

#### FWS Information and Policies

Students who have a FWS award that will be used at a student employment job may be required to complete a form indicating they and their employer have read and will comply with the requirements of the FWS program. This form is only required at UH Mฤnoa and should be submitted to the student employment office.

#### General Confidentiality Notice (GCN)

Students who will have access to sensitive or personally identifiable information may be required to complete the General Confidentiality Notice. The form can be done in print or through the ACER site ([https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/)). Printed forms should be retained within your department and not sent to student employment.

#### Multi-Job Memo

A student working more than one student employment job may be required to complete a Multi-Job Memo if the campus requires it. Each supervisor acknowledges that the student will not exceed 20 hours per week between the two jobs during the academic periods. This form is currently only required at UH Mฤnoa, though students being hired into a Mฤnoa position may be asked to have their employers at other campuses complete the form.

#### PTS Enrollment Form

Student employees that are FICA Not Exempt from at any time will need to complete the PTS Enrollment form. They will only need to do so once so long as there is no significant break in employment (over a year), even if the student switches between *Exempt* and *Not Exempt* several times. This form is routed through your department's personnel office and should not be sent to the student employment office.

### Steps for Initiating a Hire

{help-job-hire-1}

{help-hire-job-2}

> #### Static Fields
> Static fields are fields you cannot type into or change. When a field is static, and the information is inaccurate, you will need to contact your campus' student employment office to have the change made or receive instructions on how the change can be made. Changes to *Duties* and *Qualifications* can be requested from the Job page using the *Request Update to Locked Data* button.

The Hire transaction receives a number of approvals along the way to being processed into the payroll system. The flowchart below summarizes the process a hire transaction goes through.

### Create the Hire Transaction

Any user listed in section 2 may create the hire transaction using the *Hire* button as described earlier. If the creator does not check their approval box, the first approver in the chain will be notified to approve the transaction when the transaction is saved. If the creator does approve the transaction, the next approver after them in the chain will be notified instead.

### Departmental Approvals

Once created, the hire transaction will need to route through the department to receive all additional approvals. These approvals are determined by the usernames inputted into section 2 of the job. As each user approves the transaction, the next approver in the chain will receive an email notifying them that the transaction is awaiting their approval.

Any user further down in the chain may bypass the approval of those preceding them in the chain. This is sometimes necessary when an approver is unavailable or does not have placement access. Once an individual has approved the transaction they will be unable to make any further changes, though those who have yet to approve may still make changes.

### Fiscal Authority Approval

Once all of the normal departmental approvals have been done, the Fiscal Authority will need to do their approval. If the Fiscal Authority is unavailable, the backup FA may approve in their stead. Backup Fiscal Authority is not required normally and the transaction does not route to the backup FA when the FA approves the transaction.

Many of the fields on the Hire can be left blank up until this point, if you so desire, but all required fields must be filled before the Fiscal Authority can approve the hire. When the FA does their approval the system will validate that all required fields are completed and that the account codes are active. Should there be any problems, the FA will receive the error message in red. Once the FA or backup FA has approved the transaction, no further changes can be made to the Hire transaction. If changes to the Hire transaction need to be made after the FA or backup FA has done their approval, please contact your campusโ SE office to request said changes.

### SE Approval

The Hire transaction will then route to the appropriate student employment office for review and approval based on the funding source of the job. Approvals typically occur within three to five business days. Missing supplemental forms or errors on the hire may cause delays.

If there is a problem, the hire transaction will be placed on HOLD by the student employment office and you should be contacted shortly with an explanation of the situation. If the transaction is approved by the student employment office, you should receive an email indicating the transaction has been approved. Students are allowed to start working once this approval email has been received.

### Changing Locked Fields on Hires

Certain aspects of a hire will be locked and cannot be edited by you as the employer on the Hire transaction. Some aspects, such as the *Job Information* and the *Approval Information* sections may not be changed on the hire transaction once it has been generated. In these cases, the hire transaction must be deleted and recreated once the Job record is corrected.

If you need to make changes to any of the parts of the hire transaction indicated below, contact your SE office or leave comments on the hire transaction making the request.

#### Student's Personal Information

Certain aspects of the studentโs information cannot be changed by you as the employer. If you notice that the studentโs name, social security number, date of birth, or gender are inaccurate, consult your SE office.

Corrections to the SSN or name may require the submission of documentation to UH Payroll. If the date of birth or gender are inaccurate, the SE office may need to work with the ITS team to make the correction. The student may also want to check with the records office of their home campus to correct the information on their regular student record.

#### Starting at a Higher Step

Student hires are normally always started at the first step of their pay class. If you are rehiring a student, or the student possesses prior experience that you feel merits consideration, you may make a request for the student be started at a higher step.

Most commonly this means having the student hired at the step they were at when they were last in your employ in the same position. This request is usually made by leaving comments to student employment on the hire transaction, though individual campuses may have their own procedures.

#### Marital Status (International Students)

International students who qualify as nonresident aliens must indicate *Single* on the Hire transaction for tax purposes. Most international students will fall into this category.

If the student passes the substantial presence test, thus qualifying as a resident alien for tax purposes, they can request that the Hire transaction reflect their accurate marital status. This change must be made by your SE office. See the IRS document called *Notice 1392* for additional information.

# Placements Tab

> If you do not see the Placements tab, you do not have Placement Access. Contact your Department Liaison or Campus Liaison to request the training to get this access. If you do not know who your Liaison is, contact the Student Employment office at your campus.

## Transaction Types

This section provides a brief description of each of the different transaction types you may create for a student employee. Once created, transactions will route for departmental approvals just as a hire transaction would. The full details on each transaction type are presented after this brief introduction.

#### Data Chg - Student Personal Info

This transaction is used to change one or more pieces of information related to the student. This includes the option to change the studentโs address, citizenship status, marital status, and tax exemptions. Only the fields changed under the *To:* column will be updated and all fields left blank will remain the same.

#### Data Chg - FICA

This transaction is used to change a studentโs record so that they are either exempt or not exempt from FICA taxes. Please see the *Summer FICA Tax Information* and the *Student Assistant FICA Questionnaire* for more details on FICA. The detailed section on this transaction also has more details.

#### Data Chg - Appt Period

This transaction is used to change or update the studentโs appointment period. Whenever the studentโs current appointment period ends, you should update their appointment period using this transaction. The appointment period defines the current period in which you intend to employ the student, not to exceed one year.

#### Rate Chg - Step Increase within Same Class

This transaction is used to grant a student a step increase. The transaction moves a student up one step on the pay scale within their current class. Step increases can only be granted if six or more months have passed since the studentโs last step increase, promotion, or hire date. Students that work for one year from their last step increase, promotion, or hire date, and who work 400 or more hours during that period, are entitled to a mandatory step increase.

#### Rate Chg - Promo to New Class

This transaction is used to grant a student a promotion. The transaction allows you to move a student up to any higher pay class within the same series (same job number). You will need to create the new jobs in the series before promoting students to them if these jobs do not already exist. The student should meet the qualifications and be able to perform the duties of the new pay class.

#### Rate Chg - Downgrade to New Class

This transaction is used to downgrade a student to a lower pay class within the same series. Downgrading a student requires the approval of your student employment office and should be justified. This is typically allowed after a student was temporarily promoted to a higher pay class for performing advanced duties, and is now resuming their normal tasks. Considerations for a step increase at the lower class may be requested, especially if the employee was at a higher step in that lower pay class before the promotion.

#### Fund Chg - Add New Account Code

This transaction is used to add a new account code to a studentโs record. Adding an account code allows you to pay the student from the new account. These transactions usually only require student employment approval when using the *F1-Federal Work Study* payroll number.

#### Fund Chg - Change or Terminate Account Code

This transaction is used to either change an existing account code on the studentโs record or to terminate an account code on the studentโs record. Note that terminating all account codes will result in terminating the studentโs record on the payroll system, ending their employment. Certain changes will require student employment approval, such as changing the payroll number to *F1-Federal Work Study* or changing the *Warrant Distribution Code*. Note that students cannot be terminated until two pay periods after they receive their last pay check.

> #### Timing Transactions
> A transaction will generally take effect on the date it is processed in the Payroll system, which is usually, but not always, the business day that it receives its final approval. Some transactions, such as FICA, have more specific timing issues.

### Transaction Approval Process

Every transaction will route through the approver list for approvals. When a transaction is created, the person creating it usually does the first approval, progressing through the chain of approvers. If the creator of the transaction does not approve it, it will route to the first person in the approval chain instead.

#### List of Approvers

The list of approvers is set in section 2 on the Job when the job is created. You must have a Supervisor and a Fiscal Authority listed.

{help-placement-job-approval}

{help-placement-plc-approval}

#### Changing Approvers

If you need to change approvers for a Job, navigate into the job as discussed previously and make the changes in section 2 (*Transaction and Placement Approval Information*) on the job. Please note that once a transaction has been created, the approval list will be fixed on the transaction and cannot be changed. Changing the approvers on the job will prevent those removed from approving the transaction. If you wish to change the approvers at this point you will need to delete the transaction and recreate it.

#### Routing for Approvals

The transaction will route starting with the first person in the chain or the next person in the chain after the creator, assuming the creator approves it, if the creator of the transaction is not the first approver. Approvals proceed from the top down. Each user will receive an email when the transaction is awaiting their approval. Once the Fiscal Authority or their backup approves the transaction, it will move on to student employment for final approval (if necessary) or finalize on the system.

#### Bypassing Approvals

Any approver can go in and approve a transaction before it is their turn, bypassing the approvals of those above them. Bypassing a Supervisor is generally discouraged, but circumstances may require it from time to time. Bypassing is most commonly used when an approver does not yet have placement access or is unavailable.

### Data Chg - Student Personal Info

{help-trans-stdinfo-1}

{help-trans-stdinfo-2}

> #### Records & Name Changes
> Changing information using this transaction only affects the Payroll record. If the student wishes to change this information on their student record and/or sece, they will need to make the change with the Records office. 
>
> If the student changes their name or SSN, you should contact your student employment office for information. Typically, this involves a memo requesting a name/SSN change and a photocopy of the studentโs Social Security Card showing his/her new name being forwarded to Payroll or the appropriate office.

### Data Chg - FICA

{help-trans-fica}

> #### Transaction Approval Notice
> Unlike most transactions, FICA transactions only require one approval. If anyone on the approval list approves, the transaction will finalize.

#### What is FICA

FICA is essentially payroll taxes that a student is normally exempt from during the regular academic periods (Fall/Spring). A student that is not exempt from FICA, for whatever reason, has their earnings subject to an assessment for PTS Deferred Compensation equal to 7.50% of gross wages before taxes and a Medicare tax of 1.45% (and 1.45% charged to the employer). Should you or the student want more details, a booklet explaining PTS Deferred Compensation can be found on the *Forms and Info* tab.

The FICA questionnaire can be used to determine the FICA status of a student for any given academic period, though classified students are typically only *K0-Not exempt* during summer sessions, so FICA is primarily a concern at the end of the Spring semester. Please consult with your Fiscal Authority or your student employment office if you have additional questions.

#### Timing Transactions

If a student is exempt from FICA taxes for even one day in a pay period, they are exempt for the entire pay period. If there are less than five weeks between the end of their exemption and the start of the next term in which they are exempt, they may be left as exempt for that intervening period as well. Consult the FICA memorandum issued by Payroll (*Forms and Info* tab) for the dates on which to input changes.
