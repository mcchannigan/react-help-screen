# Introduction

The ***sece*** system is a web-based application that allows both University and Non-University employers to advertise and manage their job listings. When these jobs are approved they are added to the jobs database where they become available to eligible students. Job listings will remain on record and can be reused by employers.

UH employers are also allowed to create and manage student placement records that interface with the University of Hawaii's payroll system. This ability to create and manage placement records is contingent upon receiving training on the ***sece*** system from an authorized representative from your campus or department.

## Campus/Department Liaisons

UH Manoa employers will have a department liaison and employers at all other campuses will have a campus liaison. These liaisons serve as an intermediary between the student employment office at the campus and the end-users.

In addition to conveying information and updates from the student employment office, liaisons are responsible for training employers on the ***sece*** system. This training is required in order to receive what is called Placement Access. Placement Access allows an employer to create and approve placement transactions.

## Confirmation and Error Messages

When using the ***sece*** system, you will receive a message whenever you submit or save a transaction. The page will refresh and the message will appear above the transaction header. If it says the data was updated successfully, the transaction had no problems and was saved or submitted. A red message indicates that there was a problem and the issues should be indicated by red text on the transaction.

## Website Problems

When using the ***sece*** system, if you encounter a problem you may contact support at [sece-help@lists.hawaii.edu](mailto:sece-help@lists.hawaii.edu). Before doing so, you may want to check to make sure your browser is set to accept cookies and that your firewall is not blocking the site. If the problem is a display error, you may want to make sure you are running the most current version of your browser or try using a different browser.

## Navigating the Site

The following are some basic tips for navigating on the ***sece*** system:

* __Drop-Down Fields:__ These fields limit the user to selecting from a series of set options.
* __Help Icons:__ The solid icon with a white question mark inside is a link that can be clicked to get a pop-up with helpful information about a page or a section of a page.
* __Image Links:__ These are images that link to other pages or pop-ups. When you mouse-over an image link the mouse icon will change to a pointing hand.
* __Searches:__ When conducting a search you can search by full words/names or you can use a wildcard to search by part of a word/name.
  To perform a wildcard search, type the first few letters and end with a % symbol. For example, searching using "pan%" will search for all words starting with the letters "pan."
* __Sub-Tabs:__ When on some tabs, a series of text links at the top of the page may appear. These are called sub-tabs and they take you to different screens within that section.
* __Tabs:__ Similar to tabs in a binder, these tabs at the top of the screen divide the functions of sece into related functions. For the employer, these tabs are Jobs/Other, Placements/Forms, and Timesheet.
* __Text Fields:__ White text fields can be typed in-to by the user.
* __Text Links:__ Text links will appear as text that is underlined or dark blue. Clicking on a text link will typically take you to another page linked to that text. When you mouse-over a text link the mouse icon will change to a pointing hand.
* __Timing Out:__ If you are idle while logged in for around 15 minutes, the system will log you out. Please keep this in mind while creating jobs or doing other lengthy actions, as this could cause you to lose your data. Saving periodically will prevent the system from logging you out.

## EEO/AA

The University of Hawaii is an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Affirmative Action (AA) employer, and as such, users of the sece system must comply with the relevant federal and state laws and regulations.

## FERPA

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Employers should consult the relevant laws before releasing information to anyone other than the student.

## Administrative Procedures Manuals

The Administrative Procedures Manuals (APM) can be found as a link on the Placements/Forms tab of sece. These two documents define the policies and procedures governing student employment at the University. [APM A9.860](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/ap9.860.pdf) defines grievance procedures and [APM A9.880](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ap&policyChapter=9&policyNumber=880) covers all other policies and procedures related to student employment.

## The Hiring Process

The following is a brief introduction to the hiring process. For more details, please refer to the Hiring Policies & Procedures document on the _Forms and Info_ tab, or [Hiring a Student Employee](#hiring-a-student-employee) in this document.

1. Create a job or open an existing job on the sece system.
2. Eligible students interested in the position will add the job to their job cart. If they are interested in applying for the position, they will hit the apply button that adds them to your applicant list.
3. Students apply for the position as the employer indicated on the job.
4. The best candidate is selected and an offer is made. Those not selected should be promptly informed so they can continue their job search.
5. The employer creates the Hire transaction using the Hire button on the applicant list. The job should be closed if no further recruitment will be done. Note that you can only generate Hires and/or close jobs after either five candidates add it to their job cart or three days have passed.
6. The student will need to do the Federal Form I-9 with the SE office of the campus with which the job is affiliated. Additional forms might be required.
7. The student should complete the tax forms H-4 and HW-4 with the employer. The employer retains these documents and uses them to complete the federal and state withholding section of the Hire transaction.
8. Students should not begin working until the online Hire transaction has been approved by your department and the campus SE office.

## Jobs Tab

The _Jobs_ tab is primarily used to create and manage job listings on sece. The following is a brief introduction to this module and some relevant information regarding jobs on sece.

### Jobs vs. Job Series

On ***sece***, all jobs are identified by a unique job number and an associated pay class (also called a pay code). When there is only one job with that job number, it can be referred to as a single job. When there are multiple jobs that share that job number, they form a job series.

{help-job-series}

Jobs in a job series should be related and progressive, such that an employer can promote or downgrade a student without having to go through the hiring process again. A series may have up to seven jobs, one for each pay class (A1-A7). A typical series will look something like the following series:

| Job# | Position Title                 |
|------|--------------------------------|
|348-A1|Laboratory Assistant (Trainee)  |
|348-A2|Laboratory Assistant I          |
|348-A3|Laboratory Assistant II         |
|348-A4|Laboratory Researcher I         |
|348-A5|Laboratory Researcher II        |
|348-A6|Research Assistant I            |
|348-A7|Research Assistant II           |

Each position in a job series has its own position title, qualifications, duties, location, and so on. However, the jobs share certain information that when changed on one job will be changed on all other jobs in the series. The following are the shared aspects of the jobs in a series:

* Job funding source
* Primary job category
* Job contact information
* Transaction approvers
* Timesheet approvers

## Jobs as Templates

A job on the sece system can be thought of more as a template rather than the actual hiring record. A student's hire transaction (discussed later) is the actual employment record which is generated based on the information contained in the job.

What this means is that a single job can be used to hire multiple students during a single recruitment or even be used later to hire new/additional students. For example, if you need to hire two students for the same sort of work, you can open a single job and hire both under that same job number. The only time you will need to create a new job for each hire is when the students will be performing different functions or different qualifications are required. Otherwise, a job can be re-opened and re-used as often as you need it.

### Adding Users to Sections 1, 2, and 3

To assign users to roles in section 1, 2, and 3 you will need to have their UH usernames. UH usernames are the part of their email proceeding the @ symbol in their email address. For example, if their email address is *tarao@hawaii.edu*, their UH username is *tarao*.

You may only enter usernames of individuals who have been assigned a UH username and who have the proper affiliation (staff or faculty). In addition, the user must have created a profile on sece to be entered into these sections.

### Section 1: Job/Referral Contact

Section 1 of the job is where you can set not only the contacts for the job, but also who has access to the job. Anyone listed in section 1 will be able to access and make changes to the job. It is generally good practice to have at least two users listed in this section so that if the primary contact is unavailable, someone still has access to the job.

* __Primary & Secondary Job/Referral Contact:__ The users listed in these roles, and their contact information, will be printed on the how to apply pop-up. Students applying for the position will contact these individuals.
* __Additional Job Contact:__ The user listed here can access the job (edit, open, and close), but will not be shown on the how to apply pop-up or serve as a job contact.
* __Admin Contact:__ This line is not accessible by employers. Users with administrative access may, for whatever reason, be listed here by the SE office.

One of the users listed in section one must be designated as the supervisor. Click the radio button next to the appropriate username to designate the supervisor.

### Section 2: Hire and Placement Approval

This section of the job is where you can set who will be in the approval chain for hires and transactions related to the job. When a hire or transaction is created, each user listed will be prompted to approve the transaction. A user that is lower in the chain can always opt to bypass the approval of those above them in the chain. You are not required to input a user on every line, but the supervisor from section 1 will be listed by default on the supervisor line and you must have a Fiscal Authority.

* __Preparer/Reviewer:__ Preparers usually handle the details related to transactions on behalf of the supervisor. You are not required to have a preparer.
* __Supervisor:__ The supervisor line will be automatically filled with the supervisor selected in section 1.
* __Additional Approval:__ Some departments may require additional approvals, in which case the users can be listed on these lines.
* __Fiscal Authority:__ A user must be designated as the Fiscal Authority. All transactions require the approval of either the FA or backup FA.
* __Backup Fiscal Authority:__ A user may be desig-nated as the backup FA to approve transac-tions when the FA is unavailable.

Note that users who do not have placement access will be unable to approve transactions. Until they receive this access, you may want to make arrangements to have other users bypass their approval. Please contact your department/campus liaison if you need placement access.

### Section 3: Timesheet Approvers

In section 3 you designate the timesheet approvers for any student hired under this job. Approv-ing timesheets can be done by users who do not yet have placement access.

You may designate as many users for each approval role as there are empty fields, but you must designate at least one Supervisor level approver and one Business Office level approver. You may click the *Copy* button to auto-fill the usernames from earlier sections into this section.

* __Supervisor Level:__ Supervisor level approvers generally verify the hours worked by the student.
* __Business Level:__ Business Office level approvers generally monitor the funds and compliance.

## Managing Jobs

For jobs that have already been reviewed and approved by Student Employment you have a variety of options to manage those jobs. The most common tasks are detailed in brief below. When making updates to a job, or adding to a series, the job template will look mostly like a newly created job layout with a few notable differences.

> #### Job Access
> You can only view and manage jobs to which you have access. To have access, you must be listed in section 1 on the job as a contact person.

### Open/Close Jobs

You can open and close jobs in two ways. First, you can quickly do so by using the drop-down option under the Status column. If this option gives an error indicating the job requires updates, you will need to open/close it the second way.

Pressing on the job title will take you to the detailed view. From there you can make any updates and then press the *Submit and Reopen Job* button (or *Submit and Close Job*).

### Editing Jobs

Pressing on the job title will take you to the detailed view of the job. From there, you can make edits and updates.

### Reviewing Applicants

You can press on the button in the applicants column to view any applications that have been received. From that interface you can then view any materials they submitted and initiate hires.

### Adding to a Series

When you want to add a job to a series you will press the button *Add to Series* on the same row as the first job in that series. This will generate a duplicate of an existing job in that series that you can then edit and change to the new pay class you would like to add. Jobs being added to a series will require review and approval by your Student Employment office.
