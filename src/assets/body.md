# Introduction

The ***sece*** system is a web-based application that allows both University and Non-University employers to advertise and manage their job listings. When these jobs are approved they are added to the jobs database where they become available to eligible students. Job listings will remain on record and can be reused by employers.

UH employers are also allowed to create and manage student placement records that interface with the University of Hawaii's payroll system. This ability to create and manage placement records is contingent upon receiving training on the ***sece*** system from an authorized representative from your campus or department.

## Campus/Department Liaisons

UH Manoa employers will have a department liaison and employers at all other campuses will have a campus liaison. These liaisons serve as an intermediary between the student employment office at the campus and the end-users.

In addition to conveying information and updates from the student employment office, liaisons are responsible for training employers on the ***sece*** system. This training is required in order to receive what is called Placement Access. Placement Access allows an employer to create and approve placement transactions.

## Confirmation and Error Messages

When using the ***sece*** system, you will receive a message whenever you submit or save a transaction. The page will refresh and the message will appear above the transaction header. If it says the data was updated successfully, the transaction had no problems and was saved or submitted. A red message indicates that there was a problem and the issues should be indicated by red text on the transaction.

## Website Problems

When using the ***sece*** system, if you encounter a problem you may contact support at [sece-help@lists.hawaii.edu](mailto:sece-help@lists.hawaii.edu). Before doing so, you may want to check to make sure your browser is set to accept cookies and that your firewall is not blocking the site. If the problem is a display error, you may want to make sure you are running the most current version of your browser or try using a different browser.

## Navigating the Site

The following are some basic tips for navigating on the ***sece*** system:

* __Drop-Down Fields:__ These fields limit the user to selecting from a series of set options.
* __Help Icons:__ The solid icon with a white question mark inside is a link that can be clicked to get a pop-up with helpful information about a page or a section of a page.
* __Image Links:__ These are images that link to other pages or pop-ups. When you mouse-over an image link the mouse icon will change to a pointing hand.
* __Searches:__ When conducting a search you can search by full words/names or you can use a wildcard to search by part of a word/name.
  To perform a wildcard search, type the first few letters and end with a % symbol. For example, searching using "pan%" will search for all words starting with the letters "pan."
* __Sub-Tabs:__ When on some tabs, a series of text links at the top of the page may appear. These are called sub-tabs and they take you to different screens within that section.
* __Tabs:__ Similar to tabs in a binder, these tabs at the top of the screen divide the functions of sece into related functions. For the employer, these tabs are Jobs/Other, Placements/Forms, and Timesheet.
* __Text Fields:__ White text fields can be typed in-to by the user.
* __Text Links:__ Text links will appear as text that is underlined or dark blue. Clicking on a text link will typically take you to another page linked to that text. When you mouse-over a text link the mouse icon will change to a pointing hand.
* __Timing Out:__ If you are idle while logged in for around 15 minutes, the system will log you out. Please keep this in mind while creating jobs or doing other lengthy actions, as this could cause you to lose your data. Saving periodically will prevent the system from logging you out.

## EEO/AA

The University of Hawaii is an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Affirmative Action (AA) employer, and as such, users of the sece system must comply with the relevant federal and state laws and regulations.

## FERPA

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. ยง 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Employers should consult the relevant laws before releasing information to anyone other than the student.

## Administrative Procedures Manuals

The Administrative Procedures Manuals (APM) can be found as a link on the Placements/Forms tab of sece. These two documents define the policies and procedures governing student employment at the University. [APM A9.860](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/docs/temp/ap9.860.pdf) defines grievance procedures and [APM A9.880](https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&policySection=ap&policyChapter=9&policyNumber=880) covers all other policies and procedures related to student employment.

## The Hiring Process

The following is a brief introduction to the hiring process. For more details, please refer to the Hiring Policies & Procedures document on the _Forms and Info_ tab, or [Hiring a Student Employee](#hiring-a-student-employee) in this document.

1. Create a job or open an existing job on the sece system.
2. Eligible students interested in the position will add the job to their job cart. If they are interested in applying for the position, they will hit the apply button that adds them to your applicant list.
3. Students apply for the position as the employer indicated on the job.
4. The best candidate is selected and an offer is made. Those not selected should be promptly informed so they can continue their job search.
5. The employer creates the Hire transaction using the Hire button on the applicant list. The job should be closed if no further recruitment will be done. Note that you can only generate Hires and/or close jobs after either five candidates add it to their job cart or three days have passed.
6. The student will need to do the Federal Form I-9 with the SE office of the campus with which the job is affiliated. Additional forms might be required.
7. The student should complete the tax forms H-4 and HW-4 with the employer. The employer retains these documents and uses them to complete the federal and state withholding section of the Hire transaction.
8. Students should not begin working until the online Hire transaction has been approved by your department and the campus SE office.
