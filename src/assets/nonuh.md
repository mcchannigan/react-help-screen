If you ever forget your username or password, press the "Login Help" link under the sign in form to see options to retrieve your username or reset your password.

# Home Screen

{help-home-screen}

Your Home screen gives you an overview of your profile with statistics on your jobs.  Announcements from your affiliated Student Employment (SE) office will also appear under the "Messages/Announcements" heading.  You can use the navigation menu to access additional screens, and the user menu to view or edit your profile, change your password, and sign out of the ***sece*** system.  Press your name on any screen to expand the user menu.

## Current Statistics

Your job statistics show the number of job listings that you currently have in each status.  The last two lines, "Applications today" and "Applications for the past week" refer specifically to direct applications within the sece system that applicants have submitted with uploaded documents, such as resumes and cover letters.  Jobs that do not accept direct online applications through the sece system will not have their applicant numbers tracked on this screen.

# Jobs

{help-jobs-main}

The Jobs screen lists all of your existing jobs and provides options for you to create new jobs.  Jobs that are in OPEN or CLOSED status provide a quick menu that allows you to easily close your currently-open jobs, or re-open closed jobs.  Each open and closed job also has a button with the number of applicants listed.  Pressing this button will show you the list of applicants for your job and allow you to report a hire to your affiliated SE office.

## The Job Record

When creating a job, you will fill out information on the Job Record.  Fields that are not editable are locked for editing only by SE office administrators.  Each section of the Job Record will be covered in-depth below.

### General Information

{help-job-1}

* __Job Number:__ The job number uniquely identifies a job and is automatically assigned by the system once the job record has been saved.
* __Posting to Campus:__ This determines which campus SE office approves the job, and should be contacted with questions or requests specific to this job.
* __Program:__ The job program in which this job is classified.  Full-time jobs have this field locked as "FULL TIME."  Part-time positions can be listed under one of the following programs:
    * NONUH: The default job program for part-time jobs listed by non-UH employers
    * COOP: For cooperative education positions
    * INTERN: For paid internships
* __Status:__ Each job has a status, which helps to identify where in the workflow the job is currently.  The status will be one of the following:
    * DRAFT: When you first create and save a job, it will be kept in draft status.  You can continue to edit all fields of a DRAFT job until you decide you are ready to submit it for SE review and approval.
    * SUBMITTED: Once you are satisfied with your draft and submit it, it will go into SUBMITTED status.  This signals to your campus SE office that the job is ready to be reviewed and approved.
    * UNDER REVIEW: This status indicates that your campus SE office has begun the review process on the job.
    * HOLD: If, in the course of review, your campus SE office finds that they need additional information or action from you, they will place the job on HOLD and contact you to resolve any issues.
    * OPEN: After your job is approved, it will be opened and advertised unless you have opted to create the job for promotions only.  Jobs in OPEN status are publicly listed for students and will accept applicants.  Due to EEO requirements, all jobs must remain open until either 3 days have elapsed or 5 students have applied.
    * CLOSED: Once your job's recruitment period has ended, it will be closed.  It will no longer be publicly listed, and no more applications will be accepted by the system.  To begin your next recruitment, you may reopen the job.
* __Status Date:__ The date on which the job entered its current status. 

### Job Classification / Duties

{help-job-2}

* __Position Title:__ You should enter a specific and descriptive position title, as it gives students an idea of what the job entails.
* __Primary and Secondary Job Category:__ Select a primary job category that the job would fall under, and a secondary category if desired.  Categories help with job search filtering and are displayed in job search results.
* __Hourly Wage (Part-Time jobs only):__ For part-time jobs, enter the hourly wage in this field. Once your job has been submitted to SE for review and approval, you will no longer be able to edit the wage directly, but you can submit a request to SE to update the wage through the system using the "Request Update to Locked Data" button that will be located below the Narrative of Duties.

For full-time jobs, wage information will be entered in the next section. 

* __Qualifications Required, Narrative of Duties:__ Enter the qualifications and duties for the position.  Once the job is submitted for approval, you will no longer be able to edit these fields directly.  However, the "Request Update to Locked Data" button will also allow you to submit a request to update these fields.

{help-job-data}

### Compensation / Benefits (Full-time jobs only)

{help-job-compensation}

* __Salary / Pay Range:__ Enter the salary or hourly pay range, and select whether the entered pay is annual or hourly.

    * You can enter an expected starting date, or list the job to start ASAP

### Application Information

Select how you would like to receive applications for your job.  You may select one of the application methods below.  All methods provide the "Additional Information (to be shown to applicants)" text box to allow you to give any additional instructions.

{help-job-apply-online}

{help-job-apply-email}

### Job Contact Information

Enter the email addresses of each person that you want to have access to manage this job form.  All email addresses entered in this section must be registered to profiles in the sece system.

{help-job-contact}

This section determines who will have access to view and edit the job form, as well as who will be listed as contacts to students who apply for the job (Primary and Secondary Job Contacts).  You must also designate the supervisor for the job using the radio buttons next to the desired username.

## Applicants

Jobs that are in OPEN or CLOSED status may have student applicants for you to review.  The number of applicants will be listed on a button under the "Applicants" heading.  Press this button to see the applicant list for a particular job.

{help-job-applicants}

For jobs where you have opted for online applications, the applicant list will show the student's name, date applied, and the documents that they have applied.  You can view individual documents by pressing the corresponding link under the "Document" heading, or you can download zip files containing all of one student's documents, or all applied documents.  If you download all applied documents, the zip file will be formatted such that each individual applicant's documents are separated into their own sub-folder.  A check mark will appear next to documents that you have previously viewed.

For jobs where you have not opted to accept online applications, an applicant list will still be displayed, but without any documents to review.  Students listed in the applicant list where online applications are not accepted have signaled their intent to apply for the position and consented to have their names listed as applicants in the system in order to allow for their placement to be recorded in the system.

# Placements

{help-placements}
