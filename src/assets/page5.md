# Records Maintenance

This refers to a feature in ***sece*** that automatically performs a number of tasks related to records maintenance on the system. These tasks include tracking eligibility, mandatory step increases, and electronic I-9 expiration. If one of your student employees receives a communication from the system regarding one of these, and you have questions, please contact your campus SE office.

## Electronic I-9 Expiration

When a student employee’s electronic I-9 is near expiration, the system will generate a series of memos notifying the supervisor and the student of the situation. Typically, only the electronic I-9s of certain international students will have expiration dates, though citizens in certain rare cases might have an expiration date.

When you receive such a memo, the student will typically have one month until their expiration date, which should give them time to get their documents in order. If the student does not update their form I-9 in a timely manner, the system will begin a series of notifications that will ultimately end in termination.

The I-9 expiration function runs at the start of each month.

## Eligibility

When a student is no longer eligible for student employment, the system will generate a series of two memos to the student and supervisor notifying them of the situation. If the situation is not resolved, the student will be terminated by the system as described in the memo. The student should get in touch with the SE office of the campus with which their job is affiliated to find out why they are ineligible. Generally speaking, it is better for the student to contact the SE office when trying to resolve these situations due to FERPA considerations.

Reasons for ineligibility will vary greatly, but typically are the result of unsatisfactory academic progress or insufficient enrollment. Exceptions or special considerations are given at the discretion of the appropriate SE office. For students working at a campus other than their primary institution, they may need to work with both campuses SE offices to resolve the situation.
The eligibility function runs at the start of each academic term.

## Mandatory Step Increase

When a student has worked one year, and at least 400 hours, since their last pay increase (step increase or promotion) and/or hire date, they are entitled to a mandatory step increase. The system will automatically grant the step increase in these cases. No action needs to be taken on the part of the employer. This increase cannot be stopped or prevented, even in cases where the student is no longer working for you.

The mandatory step increase function runs at the start of each week.
