## Creating a Profile

The first time you log into the ***sece*** system you will be prompted to create a profile. If you transfer to a new job, be sure to update your profile.

## Jobs Tab

The _Jobs_ tab is primarily used to create and manage job listings on ***sece***. The following is a brief introduction to this module and some relevant information regarding jobs on ***sece***.

### Jobs vs. Job Series

On ***sece***, all jobs are identified by a unique job number and an associated pay class (also called a pay code). When there is only one job with that job number, it can be referred to as a single job. When there are multiple jobs that share that job number, they form a job series.

{help-job-series}

Jobs in a job series should be related and progressive, such that an employer can promote or downgrade a student without having to go through the hiring process again. A series may have up to seven jobs, one for each pay class (A1-A7). A typical series will look something like the following series:

| Job# | Position Title                 |
|------|--------------------------------|
|348-A1|Laboratory Assistant (Trainee)  |
|348-A2|Laboratory Assistant I          |
|348-A3|Laboratory Assistant II         |
|348-A4|Laboratory Researcher I         |
|348-A5|Laboratory Researcher II        |
|348-A6|Research Assistant I            |
|348-A7|Research Assistant II           |

Each position in a job series has its own position title, qualifications, duties, location, and so on. However, the jobs share certain information that when changed on one job will be changed on all other jobs in the series. The following are the shared aspects of the jobs in a series:

* Job funding source
* Primary job category
* Job contact information
* Transaction approvers
* Timesheet approvers

## Jobs as Templates

A job on the ***sece*** system can be thought of more as a template rather than the actual hiring record. A student's hire transaction (discussed later) is the actual employment record which is generated based on the information contained in the job.

What this means is that a single job can be used to hire multiple students during a single recruitment or even be used later to hire new/additional students. For example, if you need to hire two students for the same sort of work, you can open a single job and hire both under that same job number. The only time you will need to create a new job for each hire is when the students will be performing different functions or different qualifications are required. Otherwise, a job can be re-opened and re-used as often as you need it.

### Adding Users to Sections 1, 2, and 3

To assign users to roles in section 1, 2, and 3 you will need to have their UH usernames. UH usernames are the part of their email proceeding the @ symbol in their email address. For example, if their email address is *tarao@hawaii.edu*, their UH username is *tarao*.

You may only enter usernames of individuals who have been assigned a UH username and who have the proper affiliation (staff or faculty). In addition, the user must have created a profile on ***sece*** to be entered into these sections.

### Section 1: Job/Referral Contact

Section 1 of the job is where you can set not only the contacts for the job, but also who has access to the job. Anyone listed in section 1 will be able to access and make changes to the job. It is generally good practice to have at least two users listed in this section so that if the primary contact is unavailable, someone still has access to the job.

* __Primary & Secondary Job/Referral Contact:__ The users listed in these roles, and their contact information, will be printed on the how to apply pop-up. Students applying for the position will contact these individuals.
* __Additional Job Contact:__ The user listed here can access the job (edit, open, and close), but will not be shown on the how to apply pop-up or serve as a job contact.
* __Admin Contact:__ This line is not accessible by employers. Users with administrative access may, for whatever reason, be listed here by the SE office.

One of the users listed in section one must be designated as the supervisor. Click the radio button next to the appropriate username to designate the supervisor.

### Section 2: Hire and Placement Approval

This section of the job is where you can set who will be in the approval chain for hires and transactions related to the job. When a hire or transaction is created, each user listed will be prompted to approve the transaction. A user that is lower in the chain can always opt to bypass the approval of those above them in the chain. You are not required to input a user on every line, but the supervisor from section 1 will be listed by default on the supervisor line and you must have a Fiscal Authority.

* __Preparer/Reviewer:__ Preparers usually handle the details related to transactions on behalf of the supervisor. You are not required to have a preparer.
* __Supervisor:__ The supervisor line will be automatically filled with the supervisor selected in section 1.
* __Additional Approval:__ Some departments may require additional approvals, in which case the users can be listed on these lines.
* __Fiscal Authority:__ A user must be designated as the Fiscal Authority. All transactions require the approval of either the FA or backup FA.
* __Backup Fiscal Authority:__ A user may be desig-nated as the backup FA to approve transac-tions when the FA is unavailable.

Note that users who do not have placement access will be unable to approve transactions. Until they receive this access, you may want to make arrangements to have other users bypass their approval. Please contact your department/campus liaison if you need placement access.

### Section 3: Timesheet Approvers

In section 3 you designate the timesheet approvers for any student hired under this job. Approv-ing timesheets can be done by users who do not yet have placement access.

You may designate as many users for each approval role as there are empty fields, but you must designate at least one Supervisor level approver and one Business Office level approver. You may click the *Copy* button to auto-fill the usernames from earlier sections into this section.

* __Supervisor Level:__ Supervisor level approvers generally verify the hours worked by the student.
* __Business Level:__ Business Office level approvers generally monitor the funds and compliance.

## Managing Jobs

For jobs that have already been reviewed and approved by Student Employment you have a variety of options to manage those jobs. The most common tasks are detailed in brief below. When making updates to a job, or adding to a series, the job template will look mostly like a newly created job layout with a few notable differences.

{help-job-manage}

> #### Job Access
> You can only view and manage jobs to which you have access. To have access, you must be listed in section 1 on the job as a contact person.

### Open/Close Jobs

You can open and close jobs in two ways. First, you can quickly do so by using the drop-down option under the Status column. If this option gives an error indicating the job requires updates, you will need to open/close it the second way.

### Editing Jobs

Pressing on the job title will take you to the detailed view. From there you can make any updates and then press the *Submit and Reopen Job* button (or *Submit and Close Job*).

The detailed view of the job will look very much like what you would see when creating a new job. The most significant differences will be noted below.

{help-job-edit-general}

{help-job-locked-data}

> #### Common Edits
> Once a job is approved, you will most commonly be updating things like the closing date, starting date, and number of openings.

> #### Editable Fields
> Note that only white fields will be editable on an existing job. Locked fields can only be modified by the student employment office. Typically pay, duties, and qualifications are locked.

### Reviewing Applicants

You can press on the button in the applicants column to view any applications that have been received. From that interface you can then view any materials they submitted and initiate hires.

When you press the *Applicants* button, you will see the following screen listing all of the applicants.

{help-job-applicants-nodocs}

{help-job-applicants-docs}

### Adding to a Series

When you want to add a job to a series you will press the button *Add to Series* on the same row as the first job in that series. This will generate a duplicate of an existing job in that series that you can then edit and change to the new pay class you would like to add. Jobs being added to a series will require review and approval by your Student Employment office.

Adding a job to a series is much like creating a new job, save that you are working from a base template rather than a blank slate. Remember that jobs in series share a number of features. The remainder of the job not shown in this guide can be edited like normal. Please note that editing section 1, 2, or 3 affects all jobs in the series and that a job added to a series must be approved by SE.
