## On-Campus

Job searches with "On-Campus" selected will list University jobs, typically located on-campus, and paid through the University's payroll, or through Federal Work Study (FWS).  The following search options are unique to on-campus jobs:

* Campus
    The campus on which the job is located.
* Special Classification
    Provides options for special classifications, such as summer-only positions.

## Off-Campus

Off-campus jobs are listed by non-University employers.  You can search for part-time or full-time positions.  The following search option is unique to off-campus jobs:

* Company
    The name of the company that listed the job.

## Search Results

After submitting a search, you will be shown a table of search results.  Press any row to view the full job listing.  If you have selected skills in your profile, any matching skills that were indicated on the job by the employer will be highlighted green in the listing.

{help-job-detail}

If you are eligible to apply for the job, there will be an "Add to Job Cart" button displayed on the listing.  Your job cart is a shopping cart of jobs that you intend to apply for.  Once you add a job to your cart, you can start the application process.  

If you are not eligible, you will instead be shown a message that states your lack of eligibility and states the reason why you are not eligible when expanded.

{help-job-ineligible}

## Saved Searches

{help-saved-searches}

You can set up saved searches to quickly run job searches with your desired criteria.  Saved searches can also be configured to email you automatically when new jobs are listed that match your saved criteria.  You can configure your saved search to email you daily, weekly, or biweekly.

# Job Cart

{help-job-cart}

Your job cart contains jobs that you intend to apply for.  Jobs will remain in your cart for 90 days, and you can apply for jobs in your cart as long as they remain open.  Jobs that close will have their "Apply Now" button disabled and relabeled "Closed" to signify the change in status.

You can press any row in the cart to review the detailed job listing, provided the job has not closed.

## Applying for Jobs

The employer listing each job will choose the process through which you should apply, and you will be shown instructions accordingly when you press the "Apply Now" button in your Job Cart.  Depending on the employer's choice, you will either apply directly through the sece system, or you will be provided with further instructions from the employer to apply outside of the system.

## Direct Online Application

You will apply online by uploading employer-requested documents, such as resumes and cover letters, to the sece system.  When your application is complete and submitted, you will be sent a confirmation email by the system that lists the job number and title to which you applied.

{help-job-application}

If you later choose to withdraw your submitted application for any reason, you may do so by pressing the "Applied" button in your Job Cart to view the details of the application, and pressing "Withdraw Application."  Your application will appear as "Withdrawn" and your name and submitted documents will no longer be visible to the employer.

## External Application

You will be shown the contact information of the employer(s), along with any additional instructions to apply, such as sending an email, calling, or applying in person.  While the employer in this case declines to accept direct applications through the sece system, they will still need to process your hire in the system.  This means that the sece system must add your name to an applicant list that is visible to the employer so that you can be hired.  The system will ask for your consent to add your name to the job's applicant list before you are shown the application instructions, as seen in the screenshot below.

{help-job-apply-offline}

# Placements

{help-placements}

When you are hired into a job, a placement record is created in the system. You can view all of your placements from the "Placements" screen.  Press any row in the list to expand to a more detailed view of a particular placement record.

{help-plc-detail}

From this detail view, you can also view historical placement transactions, such as your Student Employment Work Agreement (SEWA), pay raises, information changes, etc.

# Documents and Forms

This screen allows you to manage your uploaded documents, such as resumes, transcripts, and cover letters, as well as fill out your Form I-9 once you have been offered and accepted a position on-campus.

{help-docs}

## Documents

All of your uploaded documents are listed here.  You can download copies of any of your documents by pressing "View," and you can delete unwanted documents, provided they are not currently applied to any jobs.  If you wish to delete a document that is currently applied to a job, you may choose to withdraw the application for that job in order to free up the document for deletion (see Direct Online Application above).  You may keep up to 25 documents at a time in the system.

You can also upload additional documents by pressing "Add new Document."  You will be asked to select the file to upload, the type of file (Resume, Cover Letter, Transcripts, or Other), and to enter a brief description to help identify the file.  Uploaded documents must not exceed 250KB in size (500KB for transcript files), and must be one of the following formats: PDF, Word (DOC, DOCX), or HTML.

## Forms

Once you have been offered and accepted a position on campus, you will be asked to fill out a Form I-9 for employment eligibility verification.  Some campuses will provide you with a paper hard copy Form I-9 to complete, but others make use of the electronic Form I-9 that is provided by the sece system.  Your employer or campus student employment office will provide you with detailed instructions when you accept a job offer.  Once you have saved or submitted an electronic Form I-9, it will be listed under the "Forms" heading.
