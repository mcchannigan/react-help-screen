# Hiring a Student Employee

## Hiring Students

This section deals with hiring students using the ***sece*** system. The basic hiring process is as follows:

1. Open and advertise the job.
2. Interested and eligible students will add themselves to the applicant list and contact you in the manner specified to apply. The system also now allows online applications.
3. You review applications submitted and conduct interviews.
4. You select a candidate and complete the necessary paperwork with the student. The student may also need to complete a Form I-9 or other paperwork with your campus' student employment office.
5. You can initiate the hire transaction as detailed on the next few pages. Enter the required information on the Hire transaction. Note that some information, such as the account code, might need to be entered by your Fiscal Authority.
6. Approve the transaction by checking your approval box. This will route the hire transaction to the next approver in the chain as determined by the approver list in section 2 on the job.
7. When the Fiscal Authority approves the transaction it will route to the relevant student employment office for final approval.
8. When the student employment office approves the hire, the supervisor and student will receive an email notifying them that the hire has been approved. The student may start working once this email and they should not start before then.

### Things to Keep in Mind

The following are things you should keep in mind before trying to hire a student using ***sece***.

* __Do not interview a student who has not applied for your job.__ Only students who are eligible for your job can add themselves to your applicant list, so making sure they are on that list will save you some potential headaches down the road. Note that a change in a student's enrollment or academic status can change their work eligibility.
* __Do not accept an application in someone else's name.__ Sometimes students get contact information from friends. If the student is not on your applicant list, you will not be able to initiate a hire transaction for them.
* __Be aware that additional forms are required.__ Keep in mind that the student may have to complete additional paperwork not only with yourself, but with the relevant student employment office as well. More details on paperwork are provided later in this section.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you should encounter any problems when initiating the hire transaction, it may be one of the following common issues:

* __Be sure you are listed in section 2 on the job.__ Only users listed in section 2 can initiate a hire transaction.
* __Be sure that the job has been open three days or that five people have added the job to their cart.__

If none of these apply or correct the situation, please feel free to contact your campus student employment office.

### Supplemental Forms

The following are descriptions of the supplemental forms the student may need to complete in order to complete their hire.

#### Federal I-9 Form

This is a federal form that determines an employee's eligibility to legally work in the United States. All employees within the U.S. must complete the form and show the proper documentation. Once you have made an offer of employment to a student, and he/she has accepted that offer, the student should complete this form. By law, the form must be fully executed within three days of starting work, which is one reason why students may not start until their hire is approved by the Student Employment office at your campus.

The form is now electronic and can be started on the ***sece*** system by the student, who will complete section 1 and then submit it. Once this is done, the student should bring the required documents to the relevant campus' student employment office to finish the form. Electronic I-9s are good at any campus in the UH system that uses the electronic form.

#### Federal Tax Withholding Form (W-4)

This form is used to determine the Federal income tax withholdings for the employee. The completed form should be retained within your department.

#### State Tax Withholding Form (HW-4)

This form is used to determine the State of Hawaii income tax withholdings for the employee. The completed form should be retained within your department.

### Additional Forms

Some or all of the following forms may be required based on circumstances and your campus' policies. These forms are not part of the standard hiring process, but rather they address special cases or forms.

#### 90-Day Extension

When a student completing a form I-9 presents a receipt for a replacement document, they may be required to complete a 90-day extension memo. A student presenting a receipt for a replacement document has 90 days to return with the actual document. This particular form is only required at UH Mānoa.

#### FICA Questionnaire

The [FICA Questionnaire](https://www.hawaii.edu/sece/forms/FICA-Questionnaire.pdf) is used to determine whether or not a student is *Exempt* from FICA taxes. While this is primarily used to determine their status for the summer months, it can also be used to make this determination for the regular academic terms as well. Typically only Unclassified students will be *Not Exempt* during the regular academic terms (Fall/Spring). The questionnaire does not need to be sent to the student employment office. A flowchart for determining FICA eligibility is included in the questionnaire PDF.

#### FWS Information and Policies

Students who have a FWS award that will be used at a student employment job may be required to complete a form indicating they and their employer have read and will comply with the requirements of the FWS program. This form is only required at UH Mānoa and should be submitted to the student employment office.

#### General Confidentiality Notice (GCN)

Students who will have access to sensitive or personally identifiable information may be required to complete the General Confidentiality Notice. The form can be done in print or through the ACER site ([https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/](https://www.hawaii.edu/its/acer/)). Printed forms should be retained within your department and not sent to student employment.

#### Multi-Job Memo

A student working more than one student employment job may be required to complete a Multi-Job Memo if the campus requires it. Each supervisor acknowledges that the student will not exceed 20 hours per week between the two jobs during the academic periods. This form is currently only required at UH Mānoa, though students being hired into a Mānoa position may be asked to have their employers at other campuses complete the form.

#### PTS Enrollment Form

Student employees that are FICA Not Exempt from at any time will need to complete the PTS Enrollment form. They will only need to do so once so long as there is no significant break in employment (over a year), even if the student switches between *Exempt* and *Not Exempt* several times. This form is routed through your department's personnel office and should not be sent to the student employment office.

### Steps for Initiating a Hire

> #### Static Fields
> Static fields are fields you cannot type into or change. When a field is static, and the information is inaccurate, you will need to contact your campus' student employment office to have the change made or receive instructions on how the change can be made. Changes to *Duties* and *Qualifications* can be requested from the Job page using the *Request Update to Locked Data* button.

## Hiring Process

The Hire transaction receives a number of approvals along the way to being processed into the payroll system. The flowchart below summarizes the process a hire transaction goes through.

  <div class="flowchart-box">Routes to Fiscal Authority for approval</div>
  <div class="flowchart-box">Routes to your SE office for final approval</div>
  <div class="flowchart-box">Processed in the payroll system</div>
</figure>

### Create the Hire Transaction

Any user listed in section 2 may create the hire transaction using the *Hire* button as described earlier. If the creator does not check their approval box, the first approver in the chain will be notified to approve the transaction when the transaction is saved. If the creator does approve the transaction, the next approver after them in the chain will be notified instead.

### Departmental Approvals

Once created, the hire transaction will need to route through the department to receive all additional approvals. These approvals are determined by the usernames inputted into section 2 of the job. As each user approves the transaction, the next approver in the chain will receive an email notifying them that the transaction is awaiting their approval.

Any user further down in the chain may bypass the approval of those preceding them in the chain. This is sometimes necessary when an approver is unavailable or does not have placement access. Once an individual has approved the transaction they will be unable to make any further changes, though those who have yet to approve may still make changes.

### Fiscal Authority Approval

Once all of the normal departmental approvals have been done, the Fiscal Authority will need to do their approval. If the Fiscal Authority is unavailable, the backup FA may approve in their stead. Backup Fiscal Authority is not required normally and the transaction does not route to the backup FA when the FA approves the transaction.

Many of the fields on the Hire can be left blank up until this point, if you so desire, but all required fields must be filled before the Fiscal Authority can approve the hire. When the FA does their approval the system will validate that all required fields are completed and that the account codes are active. Should there be any problems, the FA will receive the error message in red. Once the FA or backup FA has approved the transaction, no further changes can be made to the Hire transaction. If changes to the Hire transaction need to be made after the FA or backup FA has done their approval, please contact your campus’ SE office to request said changes.

### SE Approval

The Hire transaction will then route to the appropriate student employment office for review and approval based on the funding source of the job. Approvals typically occur within three to five business days. Missing supplemental forms or errors on the hire may cause delays.

If there is a problem, the hire transaction will be placed on HOLD by the student employment office and you should be contacted shortly with an explanation of the situation. If the transaction is approved by the student employment office, you should receive an email indicating the transaction has been approved. Students are allowed to start working once this approval email has been received.

### Changing Locked Fields on Hires

Certain aspects of a hire will be locked and cannot be edited by you as the employer on the Hire transaction. Some aspects, such as the *Job Information* and the *Approval Information* sections may not be changed on the hire transaction once it has been generated. In these cases, the hire transaction must be deleted and recreated once the Job record is corrected.

If you need to make changes to any of the parts of the hire transaction indicated below, contact your SE office or leave comments on the hire transaction making the request.

#### Student's Personal Information

Certain aspects of the student’s information cannot be changed by you as the employer. If you notice that the student’s name, social security number, date of birth, or gender are inaccurate, consult your SE office.

Corrections to the SSN or name may require the submission of documentation to UH Payroll. If the date of birth or gender are inaccurate, the SE office may need to work with the ITS team to make the correction. The student may also want to check with the records office of their home campus to correct the information on their regular student record.

#### Starting at a Higher Step

Student hires are normally always started at the first step of their pay class. If you are rehiring a student, or the student possesses prior experience that you feel merits consideration, you may make a request for the student be started at a higher step.

Most commonly this means having the student hired at the step they were at when they were last in your employ in the same position. This request is usually made by leaving comments to student employment on the hire transaction, though individual campuses may have their own procedures.

#### Marital Status (International Students)

International students who qualify as nonresident aliens must indicate *Single* on the Hire transaction for tax purposes. Most international students will fall into this category.

If the student passes the substantial presence test, thus qualifying as a resident alien for tax purposes, they can request that the Hire transaction reflect their accurate marital status. This change must be made by your SE office. See the IRS document called *Notice 1392* for additional information.

# Placements Tab

> If you do not see the Placements tab, you do not have Placement Access. Contact your Department Liaison or Campus Liaison to request the training to get this access. If you do not know who your Liaison is, contact the Student Employment office at your campus.

## Transaction Types

This section provides a brief description of each of the different transaction types you may create for a student employee. Once created, transactions will route for departmental approvals just as a hire transaction would. The full details on each transaction type are presented after this brief introduction.

#### Data Chg - Student Personal Info

This transaction is used to change one or more pieces of information related to the student. This includes the option to change the student’s address, citizenship status, marital status, and tax exemptions. Only the fields changed under the *To:* column will be updated and all fields left blank will remain the same.

#### Data Chg - FICA

This transaction is used to change a student’s record so that they are either exempt or not exempt from FICA taxes. Please see the *Summer FICA Tax Information* and the *Student Assistant FICA Questionnaire* for more details on FICA. The detailed section on this transaction also has more details.

#### Data Chg - Appt Period

This transaction is used to change or update the student’s appointment period. Whenever the student’s current appointment period ends, you should update their appointment period using this transaction. The appointment period defines the current period in which you intend to employ the student, not to exceed one year.

#### Rate Chg - Step Increase within Same Class

This transaction is used to grant a student a step increase. The transaction moves a student up one step on the pay scale within their current class. Step increases can only be granted if six or more months have passed since the student’s last step increase, promotion, or hire date. Students that work for one year from their last step increase, promotion, or hire date, and who work 400 or more hours during that period, are entitled to a mandatory step increase.

#### Rate Chg - Promo to New Class

This transaction is used to grant a student a promotion. The transaction allows you to move a student up to any higher pay class within the same series (same job number). You will need to create the new jobs in the series before promoting students to them if these jobs do not already exist. The student should meet the qualifications and be able to perform the duties of the new pay class.

#### Rate Chg - Downgrade to New Class

This transaction is used to downgrade a student to a lower pay class within the same series. Downgrading a student requires the approval of your student employment office and should be justified. This is typically allowed after a student was temporarily promoted to a higher pay class for performing advanced duties, and is now resuming their normal tasks. Considerations for a step increase at the lower class may be requested, especially if the employee was at a higher step in that lower pay class before the promotion.

#### Fund Chg - Add New Account Code

This transaction is used to add a new account code to a student’s record. Adding an account code allows you to pay the student from the new account. These transactions usually only require student employment approval when using the *F1-Federal Work Study* payroll number.

#### Fund Chg - Change or Terminate Account Code

This transaction is used to either change an existing account code on the student’s record or to terminate an account code on the student’s record. Note that terminating all account codes will result in terminating the student’s record on the payroll system, ending their employment. Certain changes will require student employment approval, such as changing the payroll number to *F1-Federal Work Study* or changing the *Warrant Distribution Code*. Note that students cannot be terminated until two pay periods after they receive their last pay check.

> #### Timing Transactions
> A transaction will generally take effect on the date it is processed in the Payroll system, which is usually, but not always, the business day that it receives its final approval. Some transactions, such as FICA, have more specific timing issues.

### Transaction Approval Process

Every transaction will route through the approver list for approvals. When a transaction is created, the person creating it usually does the first approval, progressing through the chain of approvers. If the creator of the transaction does not approve it, it will route to the first person in the approval chain instead.

#### List of Approvers

The list of approvers is set in section 2 on the Job when the job is created. You must have a Supervisor and a Fiscal Authority listed.

{help-placement-job-approval}

{help-placement-plc-approval}

#### Changing Approvers

If you need to change approvers for a Job, navigate into the job as discussed previously and make the changes in section 2 (*Transaction and Placement Approval Information*) on the job. Please note that once a transaction has been created, the approval list will be fixed on the transaction and cannot be changed. Changing the approvers on the job will prevent those removed from approving the transaction. If you wish to change the approvers at this point you will need to delete the transaction and recreate it.

#### Routing for Approvals

The transaction will route starting with the first person in the chain or the next person in the chain after the creator, assuming the creator approves it, if the creator of the transaction is not the first approver. Approvals proceed from the top down. Each user will receive an email when the transaction is awaiting their approval. Once the Fiscal Authority or their backup approves the transaction, it will move on to student employment for final approval (if necessary) or finalize on the system.

#### Bypassing Approvals

Any approver can go in and approve a transaction before it is their turn, bypassing the approvals of those above them. Bypassing a Supervisor is generally discouraged, but circumstances may require it from time to time. Bypassing is most commonly used when an approver does not yet have placement access or is unavailable.

### Data Chg - Student Personal Info

{help-trans-stdinfo-1}

{help-trans-stdinfo-2}

> #### Records & Name Changes
> Changing information using this transaction only affects the Payroll record. If the student wishes to change this information on their student record and/or ***sece***, they will need to make the change with the Records office. 
>
> If the student changes their name or SSN, you should contact your student employment office for information. Typically, this involves a memo requesting a name/SSN change and a photocopy of the student’s Social Security Card showing his/her new name being forwarded to Payroll or the appropriate office.

### Data Chg - FICA

{help-trans-fica}

> #### Transaction Approval Notice
> Unlike most transactions, FICA transactions only require one approval. If anyone on the approval list approves, the transaction will finalize.

#### What is FICA

FICA is essentially payroll taxes that a student is normally exempt from during the regular academic periods (Fall/Spring). A student that is not exempt from FICA, for whatever reason, has their earnings subject to an assessment for PTS Deferred Compensation equal to 7.50% of gross wages before taxes and a Medicare tax of 1.45% (and 1.45% charged to the employer). Should you or the student want more details, a booklet explaining PTS Deferred Compensation can be found on the *Forms and Info* tab.

The FICA questionnaire can be used to determine the FICA status of a student for any given academic period, though classified students are typically only *K0-Not exempt* during summer sessions, so FICA is primarily a concern at the end of the Spring semester. Please consult with your Fiscal Authority or your student employment office if you have additional questions.

#### Timing Transactions

If a student is exempt from FICA taxes for even one day in a pay period, they are exempt for the entire pay period. If there are less than five weeks between the end of their exemption and the start of the next term in which they are exempt, they may be left as exempt for that intervening period as well. Consult the FICA memorandum issued by Payroll (*Forms and Info* tab) for the dates on which to input changes.

<!-- Link to FICA flowchart? -->

### Data Chg - Appt Period

{help-trans-appt}

#### What is an Appointment Period?

When a student is hired, you must set an appointment period not to exceed a year, but renewable as you see fit. As defined by the APM the appointment period sets the period of time which you agree to employ the student. When the appointment period ends, you may terminate a student’s employment without cause; however, you may also renew their employment by submitting either this transaction or one of the others that includes the ability to update the appointment period. If you are terminating a student prior to the end of their appointment period you should give two weeks notice per the APM unless you have cause to not do so. While the expiration of the appointment period does not mean the student must stop working, you should endeavor to update the appointment period as soon as possible when it does expire.

### Rate Chg - Step Increase within Same Class

{help-trans-step}

#### Student Employment Approval

If you submit a step increase for an employee before six months have passed since their hire date (or last pay increase), the transaction will go to your Student Employment office for review. If you know you are submitting it early, we recommend leaving justification in the *Internal Comments to Student Employment* section.

#### Step Increase Rules

New hires start at the first step in the pay class and there are a total of four steps in each pay class. This is notated as the final digit in the class/step designation. For example, A21 indicates the A2 pay class and the first step, while A22 indicates the A2 pay class and the second step. The fourth step is as high as a student can go without moving up to the next pay class. Step increases can normally only be given if six months have passed since the last pay increase (step/promotion) and/or the hire date. A mandatory step increase must be given after the student has worked one year from the last increase or hire date and the student has worked 400+ hours during that period.

### Rate Chg - Promo to New Class (within same series)

{help-trans-promo}

#### Promotions

You may promote a student using this transaction to any pay class in the same job series (same job number). The student must meet the qualifications of the new pay class and be able to perform the duties indicated. Promotions are always to the first step. The job listing at the higher pay class must have been created and approved before the student can be promoted to that level.

### Rate Chg - Downgrade to a New Class (within same series)

{help-trans-demo}

#### Student Employment Approval

Downgrades require student employment approval. If you are downgrading a student that was at a higher step in the lower pay class, indicate this in the comments to restore them to that step. Leaving comments justifying the downgrade, or making prior arrangements with your SE office, will also increase the likelihood that the downgrade will be approved. Most downgrades are the result of an employee temporarily assuming greater duties.

### Fund Chg - Add New Account Code

{help-trans-add}

> #### Account Codes
> You should consult your Fiscal Authority when adding account codes if you have questions.

### Fund Chg - Change or Terminate Account Code

{help-trans-chg}

#### Terminations

One of the possible uses of this transaction is to terminate a student’s employment. The system will prevent you from initiating a termination until two pay periods have passed since the last pay date. If you check the terminate box in all of the accounts associated with the student’s employment record, this transaction will terminate the student.

#### Changing/Removing Accounts

One of the uses for this transaction is to either remove or change accounts associated with the student’s employment record. If you wish to remove account codes, but not terminate the student, check the terminate box for the accounts you wish to remove, but you must leave at least one account active. If you want to change accounts, enter the new accounts information on the *Change To:* line next to the account code you wish to change.
