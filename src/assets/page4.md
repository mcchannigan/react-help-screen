# Timesheets

## Main Menu

If you are listed as both Supervisor and Business Office in Section 3 (timesheet approvers) on any jobs, you will have *Supervisor / Business Office* listed at the top of the main page. This allows you to switch between roles with the bolded role being your current role. To switch roles, click on the role that is in link form and the system will swap roles. You will be defaulted to the Supervisor role each time you login.

> #### Can’t See a Timesheet?
> Often times when you cannot approve a timesheet it is because you are under the wrong role. If you can only view the timesheet and have no checkbox, this might be your issue. Check your current role (Supervisor or Business Office) and switch to the correct role if necessary.

### Quick View - Timesheet Status

Timesheet status displays the number of timesheets under each of the different status types. Clicking on the status type or the number in the same row will bring up a list of the timesheets currently in that status. The different status types and their meanings are detailed below (for supervisors):

* __Newly Created:__ These are timesheets created by the student, but not yet submitted to the supervisor.
Awaiting Your Approval: These are timesheets that students have submitted to the supervisor for approval.
* __Awaiting Your Revision:__ These are timesheets returned to the supervisor by the Business Office approver, usually because an adjustment is required.
* __Returned To Student:__ These are timesheets that the supervisor has returned to the student so that the student can make corrections.
* __Pending Final Approval:__ These are timesheets awaiting the Business Office approval.
* __Late Approved:__ These are timesheets that have received all approvals, but were submitted after their normal due date. These will be processed next pay period.
* __Pending Payment:__ These are timesheets that have received all approvals on time. These will be processed the next time that timesheets feed into the Payroll system.
* __Historical:__ These are timesheets that have been processed. These are available here so that they may be viewed as part of the student’s employment record.
When an employer is in the Business Office role, the main tab looks identical save that the timesheet status section is as shown above. The lines that are different from the Supervisor role are detailed below.
* __Returned to Supervisor:__ These are timesheets that the Business Office approver has returned to the supervisor for revision.
* __Pending Supervisor Approval:__ These are timesheets submitted by the student and awaiting the supervisors approval.

### Timesheets

The timesheets section includes a number of links to various functions you might wish to use. Most of these functions are not directly related to the processing of timesheets, rather they are tools to help monitor timesheets, provide information, and customize the system. Each of the links and the associated functions are detailed below:

* __Create a New/Late Timesheet:__ This function allows you to create a timesheet when a student is otherwise unable or unwilling to do so. It is considered best practice to not create timesheets for students unless there is a compelling reason.
* __Timesheet Search:__ This allows you to search for timesheets using various criteria. Like other such functions, this will only allow you to view timesheets on which you are a timesheet approver.
* __Options Setup:__ This allows you to customize the automatic emails generated by the system. You may either disable these automatic
emails or set them to go to an email address other than your hawaii.edu account.
* __Contact Info:__ This link brings up a popup that has the email addresses for timesheet-help and timesheet-tech. It also lists the various resources available to you to help answer your questions.
* __Supervisor’s User Guide:__ This link will download a pdf of the Supervisor's User Guide, which covers how to approve timesheets and use the timesheet tab functions.
* __View Reports:__ This link will take you to a page that contains a number of links to a number of prepared reports and an FAQ document.

### Schedules

The schedules section contains links to three schedules relevant to timesheets and the payroll cycle. Each of these links are briefly discussed below:

* __View Student Work Schedules:__ This allows the employer to view any student work schedules created by any student for whom he/she is a timesheet approver. Work schedules allow students to pre-populate their timesheets with hours worked when the student works a fixed schedule week-to-week.
* __View Pay Period Schedules:__ This allows the employer to view the pay period schedule as a table. This illustrates the pay period range, pay date, and associated due dates for timesheet submission and approvals.
* __View Holiday Schedule:__ This allows an employer to view the observed holidays that will occur throughout the selected year.

## Timesheet Search

There are two ways in which a search screen may be reached. First, clicking on any link in the *Timesheet Status* box will take you to a search screen pre-set to search for all timesheets of the matching status. For example, clicking on the *Newly Created* link will bring up a search automatically set to pull up all timesheets with the Newly Created status.

The second way to reach this screen is by clicking on the *Timesheet Search* link in the *Timesheets* section of the Main Menu. For this type of search you must set the parameters for the search.

> #### General Notes on Warning Icons
> At various times and in various places you may notice a warning icon from the list shown above. When you see one of these icons on the search screen, you will be unable to mass approve the timesheet. Instead, you must press on the Edit text link at the end and approve the timesheet from the detailed view. This is done to make sure you acknowledge the icon. Warning icons that appear on the timesheet in the Daily Work Hours section usually indicate that the event indicated by the icon was effective as of that date.
